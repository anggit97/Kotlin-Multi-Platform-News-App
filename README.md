Kotlin Multiplatform News App is sample implementation of kotlin multi platform

### Tech

Kotlin Multiplatform New Apps uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Kotlin] - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
* [Coroutine] - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality.
* [Dagger] - A fast dependency injector for Java and Android.
* [Swift] - a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS
* [Ktor] - framework for building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems using the powerful Kotlin programming language
* [Clean Architecture] - Practical Software Architecture Solutions from the Legendary Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) By applying universal rules of software architecture

And of course Kotlin Multiplatform News App itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
